arles_startup.0.title;A Rege Lex;;;;;;;;;x
arles_startup.0.desc;"From the King, the law". This is part of the longer phrase "A Deo rex, a rege lex", but you, and only you, are responsible for the power you now hold in your hands. The die is (literally) cast, so come, see, and conquer!\n\nThis mod was designed around giving the player more choices to militarily, economically, and culturally enrich your realm as it will hopefully enrich your own CKII experience. The greater complexity may deter some, but it is meant to be a challenge that everyone can enjoy.\n\nNota bene: ARLES will require a few moments a day after unpausing for thousands of background events to fire and create the world economy. It is guaranteed to finish so please sit back, relax, and let Isis do her work.;;;;;;;;;x
