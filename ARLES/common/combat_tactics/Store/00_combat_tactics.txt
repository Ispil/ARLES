# -*- ck2.combat_tactics -*-

### At the moment we have a pretty basic icon system for combat tactics showing
### the uniticon which has the biggest bonus value in the tactic.
### This is the sprite number for each unit:
### GOOD 1=LI 2=HI 3=PIKE 4=LC 5=KNIGHTS 6=ARCHERS 7=HORSE ARCH.
### Neutral 8=LI 9=HI 10=PIKE 11=LC 12=KNIGHTS 13=ARCHERS 14=HORSE ARCH.
### Bad 15=LI 16=HI 17=PIKE 18=LC 19=KNIGHTS 20=ARCHERS 21=HORSE ARCH.
